# ====== in this tutorial , i'm going to show you how to get input from
# a user ======

# ====== so we're basically going to allow a user to input information into our program

# ====== and I'm actually going to take the information that the user
# input's and , I'm going to store it inside a variable
# then we're going to be able to do something with that variable  ======

# ====== I just have to type out input ()   ======

# input() # ====== like this and then     ======

# ====== so I'm just going to say enter your name like  ======

# input(enter your name : ")   # ====== and I will add some variable   ======
name = input(" enter your name ")
print(" hello " + name)

   # we will give us hello + name that user write

   # we can also add some variable like age

age = input( " enter your age ")
print( "  that is cool you are "+ age)

    # we can also add some variable like where are you grom

frome = input( " enter where are you from ")
print("amazing you from " + frome )

     # we will give us (amazing you from + cuntry name that user write)
